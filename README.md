- **Project Summary**: 
  - [Summarize the Background/Motivation]: Dollar auction game is a non-zero-sum sequential game played by two or more bidders, with the objective of winning a dollar bill. The rule of the original game is The auctioneer starts the bidding at a low price, say 1 cent. Bidders can bid in increments of 1 cent, with each bid raising the price of the dollar bill by 1 cent. The highest bidder wins the dollar bill but must pay their final bid price to the auctioneer. The second-highest bidder also loses their bid but does not have to pay anything (Martin 1971, 109-111). In this project, it will base on the game theory and "Thirty-Six Stratagems" to build a game base on the original dollar auction game. The "Thirty-Six Stratagems" is a collection of ancient Chinese military tactics and strategies. It is often attributed to Sun Tzu, the author of "The Art of War," although its origins are not clear. The stratagems provide a set of strategies and tactics for gaining an advantage in various situations, including warfare, politics, business, and personal interactions. By applying the "Thirty-Six Stratagems" into
